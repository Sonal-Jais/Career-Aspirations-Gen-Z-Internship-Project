**Why this Project:** There"s a fundamental gap between employers and GenZ employees in terms of work expectations and work style expectations. Hnce we have to fix this gap by understanding what a GenZ employee would expect from their employer.

**Current Challenges:** GenZ have a different work expectations, their ideal employer is hard to to be found and at the same time employers find it hard to attract, manage and retain GenZ workforce since they have different work policies that do not align with the expectations of an employee.

**Why working on this project:** This is a public domain project aimed at addressing the above challenges using social data collection methods and present specific insights to employers on recommending some work policies.
