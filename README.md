**Why this Project:** There"s a fundamental gap between employers and GenZ employees in terms of work expectations and work style expectations. Hnce we have to fix this gap by understanding what a GenZ employee would expect from their employer.

**Current Challenges:** GenZ have a different work expectations, their ideal employer is hard to to be found and at the same time employers find it hard to attract, manage and retain GenZ workforce since they have different work policies that do not align with the expectations of an employee.

**Why working on this project:** This is a public domain project aimed at addressing the above challenges using social data collection methods and present specific insights to employers on recommending some work policies.

**Data Collection for the Project**

Here’s a list of variables that matter, broken into two groups: Gen Z-focused and Employer-focused. I’ve thought through every angle that could influence career aspirations or employer struggles.

Gen Z-Focused Variables
These capture what Gen Z wants, expects, and faces in their career paths:

Age: Are they early Gen Z (e.g., 18-21, just entering the workforce) or older (e.g., 22-28, with some job experience)?
Gender: Does gender influence their career goals or barriers (e.g., women prioritizing flexible hours more)?
Location: Urban, suburban, or rural? Are they in a big city with tons of jobs or a small town with limited options?
Education Level: High school, college, trade school, or no degree? Does their education shape their job expectations?
Field of Study: If they studied, what was it (e.g., tech, arts, business)? Does it match their career goals?
Current Job Status: Unemployed, part-time, full-time, freelancing, or student? This shows their starting point.
Industry Preference: What field do they want to work in (e.g., tech, healthcare, creative arts, finance)?
Job Role Preference: Specific roles they’re eyeing (e.g., software engineer, marketing manager, graphic designer).
Minimum Salary Expectation: What’s the lowest pay they’d accept for their ideal job?
Work Arrangement Preference: Remote, hybrid, or in-office? How much does flexibility matter?
Work-Life Balance Priority: How important is free time or avoiding burnout to them?
Company Culture Preferences: Do they care about diversity, inclusivity, or a fun workplace vibe?
Career Growth Expectations: How fast do they expect promotions or skill development?
Job Security Concerns: Are they worried about layoffs or unstable industries?
Purpose-Driven Work: Do they want a job that aligns with personal values (e.g., sustainability, social justice)?
Mental Health Support: How much do they value workplace mental health resources or stress management?
Technology Use: Are they drawn to jobs using cutting-edge tech (e.g., AI, VR) or indifferent?
Side Hustle Involvement: Do they have or want side gigs, and how does this affect career choices?
Barriers to Employment: What’s holding them back (e.g., lack of experience, discrimination, location)?
Influences on Career Choice: Are they driven by parents, peers, social media, or personal passion?
Willingness to Relocate: Would they move for a job, and if so, how far (e.g., another city, country)?
Long-Term Career Goals: Where do they see themselves in 5-10 years (e.g., leadership, entrepreneurship)?
Employer-Focused Variables
These capture what employers face when hiring or managing Gen Z:

Industry: What field is the employer in (e.g., retail, tech, manufacturing)?
Company Size: Small startup, mid-size, or large corporation? Size affects hiring practices.
Location: Where is the company based, and does it limit their talent pool?
Hiring Challenges: What’s hard about recruiting Gen Z (e.g., unrealistic salary demands, lack of skills)?
Retention Issues: Why do Gen Z employees leave (e.g., better offers, poor culture fit)?
Training Investment: How much do they train new hires, and does Gen Z value it?
Work Arrangement Offered: Do they offer remote, hybrid, or only in-office roles?
Salary Range Offered: What’s the typical pay for entry-level Gen Z hires?
Benefits Provided: Health insurance, mental health support, vacation time, etc. What’s on the table?
Company Culture: How do they describe their workplace vibe, and is it intentional or accidental?
Gen Z Feedback: What do Gen Z employees say about working there (e.g., via exit interviews)?
Recruitment Methods: Job boards, social media, campus hiring? Where do they find Gen Z?
Perception of Gen Z: Do they see Gen Z as entitled, innovative, or something else?
These variables cover the key factors affecting Gen Z’s career choices and employer struggles. If you’re focusing on a specific industry or region, let me know, and I can narrow this list.

Step 2: Method of Data Collection
You need a method that gets honest, detailed responses from both Gen Z and employers without wasting time or money. Here are the main options, weighed for this project:

Online Surveys: Cheap, fast, and easy to distribute via email, social media, or platforms like X. Great for reaching lots of Gen Z and employers. Downside: responses might be shallow or incomplete.
Interviews: One-on-one talks (in-person or video calls) give deep insights. Perfect for employers or a small group of Gen Z. Downside: time-consuming and hard to scale.
Focus Groups: Small groups of Gen Z or employers discussing their views. Good for exploring nuanced opinions. Downside: organizing them is a hassle, and some people might not speak up.
Social Media Listening: Analyzing posts on X, Reddit, or TikTok to see what Gen Z says about jobs. Great for raw, unfiltered opinions. Downside: not structured, and you might miss specific data points.
Existing Data Analysis: Using reports or studies (e.g., from LinkedIn, Glassdoor) on Gen Z or hiring trends. Fast and reliable but might not answer all your questions.
Best Choice: Online Surveys + Targeted Interviews

Why Surveys? Gen Z is online constantly, so surveys shared on X, Instagram, or student forums will get quick responses.
They’re perfect for collecting structured data (like salary expectations or industry preferences) from a large group. You can use tools like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to keep it simple.

Why Interviews? Surveys might miss the “why” behind answers. Interviews with a few Gen Z individuals and HR managers will let you dig into their motivations, frustrations, and stories. Aim for 5-10 interviews to complement the survey data.
Why Not the Others? Focus groups are too hard to organize for a broad project.
Social media listening is great for trends but won’t give you specific variables like salary expectations. Existing data might not be fresh or tailored to your needs.

This combo balances scale (surveys) with depth (interviews) and fits Gen Z’s tech-savvy nature and employers’ busy schedules.

Step 3: User-Friendly Data Collection Questions
Now, let’s frame questions for your surveys and interviews.

These need to be clear, direct, and easy for Gen Z and employers to answer without feeling judged or bored.

I’ll split them into Survey Questions (for broader reach) and Interview Questions (for deeper follow-ups). Each question ties to the variables above and avoids jargon or fluff.
